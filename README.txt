Network simulations of self-sustained activity in networks of
adaptive exponential integrate and fire neurons

Demo files implemented using both NEURON and PyNN.

demo_cx-lts
-----------

Simulations of self-sustained AI states in a small N=500 network of
excitatory and inhibitory neurons, described by Adaptive
Exponential (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) type neurons with
exponential approach to threshold.  The connectivity is random and
there is a small proportion (5%) of LTS cells among the excitatory
neurons.  This simulation reproduces Fig. 7 of the paper below.

demo_cx_up-down
---------------

Simulations of Up-Down states in a two-layer cortical network, with
one N=2000 network and a smaller N=500 network.  Both networks have
excitatory and inhibitory neurons described by Adaptative
Exponential (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) type neurons with
exponential approach to threshold.  The connectivity is random
within each network as well as between them.  In the N=500 network,
there is a small proportion (5%) of LTS cells among the excitatory
neurons.  This simulation reproduces Fig. 13 of the paper below.

NEURON simulations of self-sustained AI states in a small N=500
network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, described by
Adaptative Exponential (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) type neurons
with exponential approach to threshold.  The connectivity is random
and there is a small proportion (5%) of LTS cells among the
excitatory neurons.  See details in the following article:

Destexhe, A. Self-sustained asynchronous irregular states and
Up/Down states in thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks
of nonlinear integrate-and-fire neurons.  Journal of Computational
Neuroscience 27: 493-506, 2009

arXiv preprint: http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0654

The code in this directory reproduces Fig 7 of that paper.

Implementation: the mechanism IF_BG4.mod implements the Adaptative
Exponential IF model together with an IF model where the spike is
simulated by a "fake conductance" mechanism.  (see details in the
mod file)

Note that this implementation is slow and not optimized.

Conversion to Python

 - requires PyNN (http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN) and any PyNN-supported
   simulator (e.g. NEURON, NEST, Brian)
